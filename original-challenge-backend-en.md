<h1 align="center">PDV ‚Äì Fast Food / Back-end</h1>

## Description üëæ
A restaurant needs to be able to register their sales easily and quickly, they work with preparing fast food, and their current methods bog dowjn the process, leaving it slower than it should be. The restaurant would like to have an intuitive environment listing all the most sold products that allows anyone to easily add them to checkout, they also want simple but modern visuals.

### Requirements ‚úÖ
- The programming language used must be PHP or JS.
- Must be developed using the newest versions.
- Use the [Devio Code Patterns](https://github.com/deviobr/code-patterns).

### User Stories üßë‚Äçüç≥
- The user will be able to see a small quantity of products on screen for quick selection.
- The user will have the option to type in the name or the code of a product to find it.
- The user will be able to add or remove items and follow along the total in the checkout cart.
- The user will be able to see the total moneys due and any change.
- Must be able to include the name of the client to whom the order will be delivered.
- When the order is finalized, a receipt will be printed to the client (thermal printer), freeing up the screen for the next order.
  - Ps: The solution is way simpler than it seems.
- The order must appear for the kitchen alongside the client's name.
- The kitchen will be able to mark orders as complete.

### Bonus Stories (optional) üíò
- The orders must appear for the kitchen in real-time.
  - PS: Using Long Pooling or WebSockets makes this easier.
- The user must be able to include an observation for the kitchen.
- The user must be able to attribute multiple payment methods on finalizing the order.
- The orders marked as complete must show up on a screen with the name of the client.

### Observations üëÄ
- You don't need to make registration routes, the logins can come from a fixed dataset.
- The bonus items are not compulsory, however if they're done they'll be very relevant and they'll show your determination alongside the role/company.
- Many diverse concepts will be taken into consideration, however the least we expect is the application of concepts of code quality and maintenance.
- Use your creativity, don't be scared, this will be a crucial factor in our analysis.

### Next Steps üöÄ
1. Make the code readily available in a GitHub repository with a README explaining the challenge.
1. Send the repo link over to: <cut>
2. Deploy it and give us a link and documentation for the API, for us to access freely
3. We will get in contact with you with the result, if we deny your application, we'll inform you the reasons why.
