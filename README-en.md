This is the repository where I'll be developing the project for the technical challenge for Devio for a role as a backend developer.

I will be using technologies that are new to me like Swagger (for API documentation), and I'll be using technologies where I already have a breadth of personal experience in using them, like TypeScript.

The deadline for delivering this project will be on May 27th, where I intend to have all stories complete, including the bonus stories!
